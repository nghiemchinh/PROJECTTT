                    <h1 class="over7">ACADEMIC OVERVIEW</h1>
                    <hr>

                    <p>
                        CHA's academic vision statement declares that “Academics is Fundamental to Cambridge Health
                        Alliance”. Just
                        over fifty years ago, Harvard University and the City of Cambridge affiliated in order to
                        radically
                        improve the
                        poor quality of medical care at its public hospital. That decision spawned a new era. Academic
                        programming
                        attracted an excellent medical staff and fostered an increasingly empathetic, curious, socially
                        committed and
                        well-trained medical community. It served to improve the health of our local communities, but
                        moreover, to
                        shape medical practice, education and policy for the nation. Our reputation is increasingly
                        well-known and
                        well-earned in our communities, the Massachusetts State House, Washington D.C, and in academic
                        centers
                        around the nation. It would not be an overstatement to say that CHA would not exist today if it
                        were
                        not for its
                        academic affiliations and pursuits.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We track academic progress in two ways: through this bi-annual narrative report and through a
                        “scorecard”.
                        This report details our efforts to advance academics and to demonstrate how these synergize with
                        CHA's
                        strategic priorities. The scorecard highlights several easily tracked and important areas of
                        emphasis and
                        accomplishment.

                    </p>
                    <h5>These are some highlights of accomplishments of the past two years:</h3>
                        <ul class="acami">
                            <li>32 CHA graduates of our residency programs joined the medical staff (77 since
                                2013);</li>
                            <li>6 Harvard faculty members were promoted, including 2 to full Professor, and 2 Tufts

                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            In this report, we contextualize CHA as a socially accountable health care system,
                            describing
                            the linkage
                            between CHA's academics and its strategic direction. We include our “Academic Scorecard”.
                            Next,
                            we
                            describe the major recent activities designed to achieve our academic vision, noting the
                            obstacles we face
                            and future plans. Brief descriptions of major initiatives and programs selected by the
                            Department Chiefs
                            follow. The report concludes with an appendix that includes our recent publication
                            citations,
                            award
                            recipients and other useful data
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This report is undoubtedly incomplete. First, the purview of the Academic Council and the
                            Center
                            for
                            Professional and Academic Development is limited to the credentialed medical staff. Second,
                            despite
                            collecting data through multiple means and surveying the Department Chiefs and Academic
                            Council
                            members repeatedly, we anticipate that individuals, programs or plans may have been
                            misstated or
                            left
                            out altogether. We regret any errors and hope our readers will give us feedback to improve
                            the
                            next
                            report.
